								<p>This course at SCAD was definitely the most impactful on me. Moving on from theoretical projects to working with an actual business in the local area made everything much more real and tangible, allowing me to see the impact of our work in the real world. </p>

								<p>In this course, I served as the project lead, overseeing the full lifecycle of our project from initiation to delivery. I delegated tasks strategically based on team strengths, formed and coordinated effective subteams, and maintained consistent communication with the client to ensure alignment at every stage. I organized and led regular team meetings, facilitated co-creation workshops to drive collaborative problem-solving, and upheld quality standards across all deliverables. In this role, I strengthened my leadership, communication, and project management abilities while guiding the team toward a successful and cohesive outcome.</p>

								<p>We were tasked with working with a local botanical boutique. We conducted extensive research into the business background, the local plant industry and national plant industry environment, and potential resources or collaborations for the business. We then designed workshops in order to create an environment where the team could work alongside the client, and guests with backgrounds in UX design and social media management to brainstorm ways for the business to reach a larger audience in the Savannah area. I was amazed as to the infectious energy that comes from a successfully ran workshop where participants feel empowered to share their ideas and collaborate effectively. I was extremely proud that our team was able to successfully design and facilitate workshops to think about different aspects of the business and come up with ways to improve or enhance them over the course of two, four-hour workshops. Keeping people on task for four hours at a time, seemed like a daunting task, but with careful planning and facilitation, we managed to maintain engagement and productivity throughout.</p>

								<p>After our two successful workshops, the team developed a social media playbook, and a website playbook for our client to implement and follow in order to grow the business. Within these, step by step recommendations and guidelines are provided, with reasoning, expected outcomes, and examples. Our client had come into the project with specific asks in order for any of our suggestions to be compatible with her capabilities. As the project lead, I made sure to keep the team focused on not just creating solutions that were exciting, but that were feasible for our client to properly implement, as anything beyond her reach would only discourage her. If you would like to view the foundation document for this project, please reach out and I would be happy to share it with you.</p>
